# Keylogger Program

## Overview:
This Python-based keylogger records keyboard input and stores it in a text file for analysis. The program features a Tkinter GUI to entice users to start typing, and it runs in the background using pynput for seamless keystroke logging.

 ## Features
 ✅ Records all keyboard input and saves it to a log file.
 
 ✅ User-friendly Tkinter UI prompts users to start typing.
 
 ✅ Runs in the background using threading for smooth operation.
 
 ✅ Error handling prevents crashes and ensures stability.
 
 ✅ Object-Oriented Design (OOP) for maintainability and scalability.

## Requirements:
 - Python 3.x
 - pynput library (pip install pynput)
 - tkinter (included with Python by default)

## Run the script:
 1. python keylogger.py
 2. Click "Start Logging" in the Tkinter window.
 3. A prompt will appear, encouraging the user to type.
 4. The program will record keystrokes in the background.
 5. Logs are saved automatically in a text file.

## Future Improvements:
- Encrypt log files for security.
- Add log file management to prevent excessive file size.
- Implement real-time log monitoring in the GUI.
- Introduce machine learning to detect unusual keystroke behavior.
